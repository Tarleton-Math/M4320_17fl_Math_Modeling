    "- Submit as email attachement(s) by the deadline to scook@tarleton.edu\n",
    "- Problems marked \"computer\" are coding projects.  They must be done in a Jupyter Notebook and submitted as .ipynb file.\n",
    "- Problem marked \"concept\" are traditional math homework problems to be worked out by hand.  They can be written either in the Jupyter Notebook as \"markdown\" cells (preferred) or neatly handwritten and scanned as .pdf.  See https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).\n",
    "- Submit Jupyter Notebooks in .ipynb format.  Files -> Download as -> .ipynb\n",
