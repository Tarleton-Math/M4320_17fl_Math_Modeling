## Final Exam Review Guide for Math Models

Pre-Midterm
- Google PageRank
- Cobweb plots
- Lotka-Volterra
- Define & compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors for linear systems
- Determine equilibrium points and their stability for non-linear systems
- Anything else on the midterm

Post-Midterm
- Draw a graph from its adjanceny matrix
- Make the adjancency matrix of a graph
- Graph theory definitions in section 15.2, 17.2, & 17.3
- Know how the Erdos-Renyi random graph model works.  If I give you a sequence uniform random numbers, draw the Erdos-Renyi graph it produces.
- Dynamics on networks - Given the network, updating rule (eg: majority-rule, SIS, etc), and the current state, determine the next state.
