Submit as .ipynb notebook by email no later than 10:00PM on Sunday December 10.  Our course final exam is the prior day - you can ask last minute questions at that meeting.

You must send all files necessary to run your program - this include any data files too.  I may want to play with your program myself.  If you have more than file, please zip them into a single archive

If you code is long and breaks up your notebook too much, you may put the code into a separate file called "simulation_code.py" and then put the following line in your .ipynb:

exec(open("simulation_code.py").read())
